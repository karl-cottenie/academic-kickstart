I am an Associate Professor in Community Ecology at the Department of Integrative Biology. I started out as an freshwater ecologist focusing on the interaction between local environmental processes and regional dispersal processes on zooplankton community composition. Along the way, I developed a strong interest in the applications of statistical (multivariate) analyses and R which led me to focus on analysing existing data sets and meta-analyses. This in turn "forced" me to collaborate on a wide variety of systems, from bacteria to plants to animals to genomic elements to molecular identification techniques. The diversity of ideas, terms, approaches from these collaborations made me appreciate differences between fields of research (within ecology but also beyond ecology), and the important role that philosophy plays in identifying and sometimes even solving these differences.
