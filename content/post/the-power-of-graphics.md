Intelligent persons have written wonderful books about creating good graphs. Today, I received two graphs in my Google Reader, and they make such powerful/funny statements that I had to show them, especially since they are visually so comparable.<br /><br />In the funny category:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.esquire.com/cm/esquire/images/dU/waistline-measurement-chart-for-men-090710-xlg.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://www.esquire.com/cm/esquire/images/dU/waistline-measurement-chart-for-men-090710-xlg.jpg" width="288" /></a></div><br />In the powerful category <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2266025/">(click here for the original article with more powerful visuals)</a>:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/assets_c/2010/09/bartelschart-thumb-454x340-24921.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="239" src="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/assets_c/2010/09/bartelschart-thumb-454x340-24921.gif" width="320" /></a></div><br />It's very unlikely that anything in my research career will produce anything that funny, or could influence the voting behaviour of a whole nation, but we can only try.
