Have you ever felt insecure, inferior, stupid, when talking to a theoretical ecologist? Here is your fall back position:<br /><br /><a href="http://xkcd.com/793/">Physicists</a>: "<img alt="If you need some help with the math, let me know, but that should be enough to get you started! Huh? No, I don't need to read your thesis, I can imagine roughly what it says." src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/physicists.png" title="If you need some help with the math, let me know, but that should be enough to get you started! Huh? No, I don't need to read your thesis, I can imagine roughly what it says." />"<br /><br />Just replace "physicist" with "theoretical ecologist", and "liberal-arts majors" with yourself, and you regain the upper hand again in any discussion ;-)
