On November 5, it was bring your kid to work day for Grade 9 students. My oldest son (Kobe) wanted to participate, so I created a fun-packed (I thought) day for him. 

The highlight for him: siting in on Sho and Nick's Biodiversity class. At dinner that evening, he could tell us all about what he learned in that class.

The lowlight for him: my biostats class. Hopefully I have not ruined statistics for him.

The highlight for me: our time with Alex when he explained how he takes his gigapan pictures, seeing the fox den on campus, and that the name of the fencing company is Brussels.
