It is so easy to make fun of professors, we even have <a href="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics.php">our own comic strip</a>. If you believe the stereotype, we have so many laughable traits that there is a never ending list of possible punch lines. The sad part, some (most?) of them can hit really close to home.<br /><br />Recently <a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/thought-experiments-for-philosophy-101-students">McSweeney's published a more elaborate punch line on philosophy</a> to answer:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"UNIVERSE'S FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION"</blockquote>&nbsp;This is a golden oldie, and apparently it made the internet rounds already, but I became aware of it through <a href="http://www.wired.com/geekdad/">Geekdad</a> (what's in a name, right?): What is the difference between a geek and a nerd?<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.wired.com/geekdad/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Geek-versus-Nerd3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="173" src="http://www.wired.com/geekdad/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Geek-versus-Nerd3.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />And now I don't know who I am any more:<br /><br /><ul><li>My geek traits</li><ul><li>A mac</li><li>Can be pretentious and longwinded (see this blog)</li><li>A fan of gadgets</li><li>I fell for and married a non-geek</li></ul><li>My nerd traits</li><ul><li>Extreme interest or fascination with academics (see this blog)</li><li>Introverted (do not look at this blog)</li><li>Socially inept</li><li>Diverse and sometimes impractical skills due to broad interest in science</li><li>Interest might include Battlestart Galactica, computer programming</li><li>Reclusive professor</li></ul></ul>
