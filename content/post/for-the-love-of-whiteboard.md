Here is another convert of the magic of the whiteboard: <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5950957/how-a-whiteboard-helped-a-terrible-delegator-keep-a-team-on+task">http://lifehacker.com/5950957/how-a-whiteboard-helped-a-terrible-delegator-keep-a-team-on+task</a>.<br /><br />He provides a list of why whiteboards work:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"Whiteboards are big enough for everybody to see.</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">Whiteboards make you want to fill the space, and therefore expand and branch your thoughts.</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">Whiteboards inspire you to keep writing, to keep pushing on what's in your head, because it feels awesome to swing your arms that widely.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">Whiteboards feel less like you're committing to an idea than throwing it out for consideration.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">Whiteboards are nearly impossible to lose inside your backpack."</blockquote>This latter point, was until recently, my major problem: I did not have a camera with me all the time to capture each session. But now that I have a cell phone, that is solved:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eeiLieRS93s/UMB6AxqimLI/AAAAAAAAlco/PdoDfOJpIRM/s1600/IMG_20121112_134036.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eeiLieRS93s/UMB6AxqimLI/AAAAAAAAlco/PdoDfOJpIRM/s320/IMG_20121112_134036.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>&nbsp;Hopefully the information on this board will be featured in some later, more extensive, post.<br />
