It all started with this post:<br /><a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2012/01/13/interpreting-statistics/">http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2012/01/13/interpreting-statistics/</a><br /><br />which led to this post:<br /><a href="http://wmbriggs.com/blog/?p=5062">http://wmbriggs.com/blog/?p=5062</a><br /><br />which led to this post:<br /><a href="http://wmbriggs.com/blog/?p=4381">http://wmbriggs.com/blog/?p=4381</a><br /><br />which let to this post:<br /><a href="http://wmbriggs.com/blog/?p=4368">http://wmbriggs.com/blog/?p=4368</a><br /><br />And finally to this hilarious, submitted, manuscript:<br /><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.2590">http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.2590</a><br /><br />Reading them in this sequence will explain why the author, William M. Briggs, writes things like:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><blockquote class="tr_bq">"When supplicants approach us for wisdom about uncertainty, because&nbsp;of our ardent love of computation we have developed the unfortunate habit&nbsp;of insisting ﬁrst on the memorization of mathematical incantations, such as&nbsp;ﬁguring chi-squares (by hand), or we require students look to up values in&nbsp;obscure tables in the backs of textbooks. In pursuit of our love, we forget&nbsp;why civilians come to us. Even we statisticians can forget why the math&nbsp;is there. Because of this, short shrift is paid to interpretation and to the&nbsp;limitations of the methods, to what it all means, which is all that civilians&nbsp;care about."</blockquote></blockquote>or something like this (and this is only on page 4 of the manuscript):<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"This state of aﬀairs is odd because frequentist theory tells us that the&nbsp;p-value is as silent as the tomb about the truth of the theory at hand. Yet&nbsp;when a civilian cocks his ear towards a wee p-value, he hears music. Angels&nbsp;sing."</blockquote>Where is<a href="http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~ripley/"> Brian Ripley</a> when you need him? He has the same confidence of mind and writing style to potentially provide a valid counterpoint to the issue brought up by &nbsp;William Briggs, and watching these 2 alpha males take a go at each other would be very entertaining and informative.<br /><br />On another note, I wished ecological manuscripts were sometimes as personal in writing style, although I would not know what to do with a similarly written manuscript as an associated editor. I would definitely smile more when reviewing papers, that is for sure. Now we ecologists seem so boring.
