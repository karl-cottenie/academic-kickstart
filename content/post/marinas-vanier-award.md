It is finally official, <a href="http://www.uoguelph.ca/news/2011/08/u_of_g_students_11.html">Marina's Vanier Award has been made public</a>, and I can finally boast about it. 1 out of the top 167 PhD students across natural, social, and medical sciences at the Canadian level is very impressive. Congratulations, Marina.
