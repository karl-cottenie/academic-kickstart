Graduate student well-being has received a lot of attention lately. As far as I know, it has not reached the <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/university-of-guelph-seeks-to-reduce-mental-health-stigma/article34206812/">level of the urgency as for undergraduate students,</a> but graduate students are exposed to a unique set of challenges too. Two recent studies quantified these challenges: <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/blogs/student-experience-survey-2017-investigating-well-being-university">Student Experience Survey 2017: investigating well-being at university</a> and <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733317300422">Work organization and mental health problems in PhD students</a>. The second study also argues convincingly that these challenges are unique to the graduate school experience, and are not shared with similar persons in other contexts, such as for instance employees. The next important step is thus to determine what aspects of the graduate school culture can be changed at the student, advisor, department, and university level. It is relatively easy to find advice for grad students (e.g., <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/blog/2017/03/17/pursuing-a-ph-d-as-a-parent-how-to-survive/">this recent blog on how to juggle a PhD with family</a>), but what can we, as a department do differently, better, more to address these challenges?
