Last November, Marina and Amanda went to Kobe's school to give<a href="http://www.cottenielab.org/2010/11/lets-talk-microbes.html"> a hands-on demonstration of microbes</a>. The science teacher who invited them then nominated their activity to the Let's Talk Science CIHR-Synapse award, a national competition. And they were <a href="http://www.letstalkscience.ca/volunteers/science-outreach/cihr-award-showcase.html">selected as one of the 4 best showcase activities</a>! And in the accompanying picture, you can see Amanda, Marina in the background, and my son Kobe with the spiderman sweater. How cool is all that?<br /><br /><table style="width: auto;"><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/5LGmQbYAn2Pzvwu2Emmzfw?feat=embedwebsite"><img height="267" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-0tliGaZef5Q/TO1EmmJSiMI/AAAAAAAAAQU/bE4AYQ4S--I/s400/IMG_2199.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td style="font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11px; text-align: right;">From <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/cottenie.lab/201011TalkMicrobes?authuser=0&amp;feat=embedwebsite">2010-11 TalkMicrobes</a></td></tr></tbody></table>
