I have extolled the virtue of my whiteboard in previous posts (see e.g., <a href="http://www.cottenielab.org/2010/11/reduce-simplify-deepen-collaboration.html" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.cottenielab.org/2011/11/doodling-or-justifying-my-whiteboard.html" target="_blank">here</a>), but it turns out that knowing how to work with a <a href="https://sociobiology.wordpress.com/2016/10/11/chalk-talks-how-to-avoid-10-pitfalls/" target="_blank">whiteboard could actually get you a job</a>. I often say that I am a believer in technology, that it will fix a lot of problems at several scales. Sometimes the best technology, though, is an old-school magic board and markers.
