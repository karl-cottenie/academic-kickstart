Most of you readers probably followed the US elections with varying degrees of interest and passion, but as scientists are also aware of the "role" of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Silver">Nate Silver</a> and his blog <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/">FiveThirtyEight.com</a>. Lots has been written about his success, which is "just" a nice example of the strengths of the scientific process, and thus not that surprising. What does&nbsp;surprise&nbsp;me, is the reluctance of journalists to come to terms with what he does. See this very insightful <a href="http://markcoddington.com/2012/10/31/nate-silver-journalism-politics-knowledge-epistemology/">blog post by Mark Coddington</a>.<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"<span style="background-color: white; color: #4c4c4c; font-family: 'Droid Sans', arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 23px;">Silver’s process — his epistemology&nbsp;—&nbsp;is almost exactly the opposite of this:&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white; color: #4c4c4c; font-family: 'Droid Sans', arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 23px;">Where political journalists’ information is privileged, his is public, coming from poll results that all the rest of us see, too.&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white; color: #4c4c4c; font-family: 'Droid Sans', arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 23px;">Where political journalists’ information is evaluated through a subjective and nebulous professional/cultural sense of judgment, his evaluation is systematic and scientifically based. It involves judgment, too, but because it’s based in a</span><span style="background-color: white; color: #4c4c4c; font-family: 'Droid Sans', arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 23px;">&nbsp;</span><a href="http://thephoenix.com/Boston/news/146775-interview-nate-silver-explains/" style="border: 0px; color: #88c34b; font-family: 'Droid Sans', arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 23px; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">scientific process</a><span style="background-color: white; color: #4c4c4c; font-family: 'Droid Sans', arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 23px;">, we can trace how he applied that judgment to reach his conclusions."</span></blockquote>This reluctance reflects, amongst other aspects, a classic case of a an either/or role for intuition in science/data analysis. We already had a lengthy exchange about the scientific process on this blog (see for instance <a href="http://www.cottenielab.org/2012/03/fallacy-of-our-misunderstand-of.html">this</a> and <a href="http://www.cottenielab.org/2012/03/scientific-method-continued.html">this</a>), and Stefan's main critique against the scientific process as a method is maybe summarized in this statement:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"<span style="background-color: #fefdfa; color: #333333; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 16px;">I am claiming here that in order to do good science, one must know which auxiliary assumptions are reasonable to question in the face of evidence that conflicts with one’s predictions.</span><span style="background-color: #fefdfa; color: #333333; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 16px;">"</span></blockquote>One way to look at this is that intuition plays that role of knowing "which auxiliary assumptions are reasonable". So it is not an either/or relationship, but really a feedback between intuition and hypothesis testing.<br /><br />Or my last commandment: "<span style="background-color: #fefdfa; color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; line-height: 19px;">Thou Shalt Listen to thy Intuition, but Follow the Data."</span>
