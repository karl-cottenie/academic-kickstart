The joy of running for me, in addition to spending quality time with the kids, is the<a href="http://www.cottenielab.org/2011/06/thou-shalt-dream-great-dream-and-tell.html"> idle time it offers me</a>. My mind wonders off, and connects several dots that are floating around in my brain.<br /><br /><ul><li>One of these dots is <a href="http://www.cottenielab.org/2011/02/definition-of-teaching.html">this image I mentioned before</a>.&nbsp;I mentioned that creating a process to move student from the first behaviour to the second was difficult.</li></ul><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://thisisindexed.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/card2822.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="204" src="http://thisisindexed.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/card2822.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><ul><li>Another dot is why I like <a href="http://www.mokshayogaguelph.com/">Moksha yoga</a>, but could not be bothered at all by <a href="http://bikramyogaguelph.com/">Bikram yoga</a>. Below is a picture of the two weekly schedules: Several different options for Moksha, always the same for Bikram.</li></ul><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3zs-ouaDXlA/TgtXf_fXn3I/AAAAAAAAATA/lTpzP2QH2Ag/s1600/Desktop.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3zs-ouaDXlA/TgtXf_fXn3I/AAAAAAAAATA/lTpzP2QH2Ag/s320/Desktop.jpg" width="200" /></a></div><div><br /></div><ul><li>The final dot is an chapter I have been reading with Ingrid out of<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gEsmAQAAIAAJ&amp;source=gbs_similarbooks_r&amp;cad=3">&nbsp;the book "The educational imagination" by Elliot Eisner,</a> called "Educational aims, objectives, and other aspirations. We summarized our discussion in the below diagram, with a student coming into a learning environment (the box), interacting there with peers and instructors, and at the end hopefully improving is some manner. We think that the chapter distinguishes two types of objectives: expressive objectives that observe student behavior in the learning environment, and "behavioural" objectives that observe and measure&nbsp;(the difficult part) the improvement.</li></ul><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-K_VM6K-Msts/TgtbA2WAs-I/AAAAAAAAATE/1vw_Q8BnAg0/s1600/cmapEducationalAims.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-K_VM6K-Msts/TgtbA2WAs-I/AAAAAAAAATE/1vw_Q8BnAg0/s320/cmapEducationalAims.JPG" width="240" /></a></div><div><br /></div><div>So what is the connection?&nbsp;</div><blockquote><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Teaching for me consists of instruction, correction, and inspiration.</span></blockquote>Instruction is an important part of the "box" you create (see dot 3), while inspiration is why I gravitated towards moksha yoga (in this case variation, while somebody else might prefer the meditative aspect of bikram), and correction is my tool to convert "Fail" into "Learn", which I think is necessarily tied the measuring aspect of observing.
