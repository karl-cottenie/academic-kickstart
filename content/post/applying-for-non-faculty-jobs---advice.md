Every field is guilty of some form of navel gazing. Hence the abundance on how to apply for faculty jobs. Margaret Kosmala wrote a&nbsp;<a href="http://ecologybits.com/index.php/2016/10/26/some-advice-on-applying-for-faculty-jobs-according-to-six-harvard-assistant-professors/" target="_blank">recentish blog post on this</a>, with some advice I agree with, but also some I do not agree with. For instance, often departments fight over every single word in a job ad, so showing that you understand the needs that will be filled by the position (i.e., your contributions to the department and university) are important.<br />However, given one of my previous posts (<a href="http://www.cottenielab.org/2016/10/life-after-or-instead-of-academia.html" target="_blank">see here</a>), if only 10 percent of our graduate students end up in a faculty position, what resources, blog posts, advice, etc are out there for graduate students ready to make the transition?
