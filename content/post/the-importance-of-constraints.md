For me, one of the biggest mysteries of the scientific method (<a href="http://www.cottenielab.org/2011/11/embryo-or-screen-writing-of-scientific.html">see e.g. this post</a>), is that it provides such a rigid structure, yet at the same time so creative. It turns out that constraints actually lead to more global, conceptual, and maybe thus more creative thinking.<a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/11/need-to-create-get-a-constraint/"> Jonah Lehrer in Wired provides some excellent context</a> for a recent study that investigated this link explicitly. Highly recommended.<br />At the same time, this could also explain one of my other pet peeves: why <a href="http://www.cottenielab.org/2010/07/concept-maps-tool-for-learners.html">concept mapping</a> is such a powerful method. When I introduce this, I often get the complaint that it is too restrictive to think in terms of concepts and links. However, this could actually be one part of the success of this method!
