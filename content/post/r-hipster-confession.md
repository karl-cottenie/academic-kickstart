I sometimes think of myself as a science nerd, but then I read <a href="http://benjamin.mako.hill.usesthis.com/">Benjamin Mako Hill's computing set-up</a>, and suddenly it's like reading the uber science nerd manifesto. Amazingly consistent and hard-core, every single step of his work flow. And where our work flows overlap is probably in R:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 25px;">&nbsp;"R is slow and using it with big datasets gives one plenty of time to reflect on this fact. But R is also expressive, elegant, and concise for numerical and statistical work so I happily suffer through it. I make my graphs in&nbsp;</span><a href="http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/" style="color: #fe2e9a; font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 25px; text-decoration: none;" title="A plotting system for the R language.">ggplot2</a><span style="font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 25px;">&nbsp;which is so trendy that I feel that mentioning this is a sort of R-hipster confession."</span></blockquote>I wonder how quickly we can make this R-hipster confession a true internet meme? Help me out here.
