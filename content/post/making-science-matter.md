<div style="text-align: left;"><span class="Apple-style-span">Recently, I found myself eavesdropping on two elderly fellows debating an age-old question: does size matter? <i>Yes!</i> declared one.

In addition to having some of their own nifty <a href="http://www2.cec.org/nampan/page/interactive-map#bathymetry">maps</a> and <a href="http://www.cec.org/atlas/">interactive tools</a>, NAMPAN presented <a href="http://www2.cec.org/nampan/mpas">a process</a> for creating easy to understand ecological report cards that are based on clearly defined criteria. The annual report card on the status of Chesapeake Bay has become such a success that it now runs on the front page of the Washington Post every New Year’s Day and has become a call to arms amongst the general public and local decision makers.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><span class="Apple-style-span"><br /></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><span class="Apple-style-span">As visual creatures, these tools will allow NGOs, grad students, etc. to stand alongside the most seasoned academics and government scientists and tell compelling and visually appealing stories to not just the scientific community, but also to non-scientists. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Making the science matter</i>.  When it comes to marine science, this move away from typical, jargon dense and technical presentations is an absolute necessity (the worst offender at IMCC2 used text dense slides to suggest “an adaptive multi-scalable interdisciplinary framework approach” which uses a new “knowledge system” and “theoretical construct” to create “resilience in place” and a “way to move forward”). Much of the work in the marine conservation field stretches far beyond that of the scientific community and often has both social and ecological consequences. Having the tools to start communicating findings to a <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/04/27/0914292107">diverse audience</a> is a step in right direction. An informed public is more likely to demand more from decision makers and is likely to become involved in things like citizen science. <o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span"><span lang="EN-US"><br /></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span"><span lang="EN-US">At IMCC2 I attended a day long pre-conference workshop on marine <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_science">citizen science</a> </span><span lang="EN-US">—</span><span lang="EN-US"> a powerful tool for not only engaging the public (<a href="http://www.seattleaquarium.org/page.aspx?pid=268">school kids</a>, <a href="http://www.redmap.org.au/">fishermen</a>, <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/coasst/">hikers, retirees</a>, <a href="http://www.reef.org/">divers</a>, etc.) but to also generate high volumes of low cost observational data. Despite some logistical challenges, the programs have been highly successful, creating long term, information rich datasets. In addition to the audience reached by typical scientific publications, the audience reached by of word of mouth from the citizen scientists who collected the data was vast and engaged communities… making marine science matter to non-scientists.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><span class="Apple-style-span"><br /></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><span class="Apple-style-span">In a <a href="http://www.cottenielab.org/2011/06/link-between-improvement-of-environment.html">recent post</a>, Karl wrote on the social benefits of conservation and the value of evaluating the successes and failures of conservation initiatives. One of the sources of failure cited in several conservation projects in <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/105/28/9457.full.pdf+html">Tallis et al. (2008)</a> was a lack of communication infrastructure. Successful projects, on the other hand, informed the public of they were doing and why conservation mattered, backing it up with sound science. <o:p></o:p></span></span></div><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 115%;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><div><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 115%;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><br /></span></span></div>During my time in the Cottenie Lab I spent a lot of time grappling with how scientists choose to communicate and engage with the public. As I move to the next stage in my post-undergrad career I have a feeling that this type of communication will become a central theme. Beginning this August I’ll be starting a seven month internship with the <a href="http://coady.stfx.ca/coady/">Coady Institute</a>. I’m heading down to <a href="http://maps.google.ca/maps?q=saint+vincent+and+the+grenadines&amp;ll=12.715368,-61.185608&amp;spn=1.513712,2.705383&amp;gl=ca&amp;t=h&amp;z=9">Saint Vincent and the Grenadines</a> to help facilitate the creation of a network of marine protected areas. I’ll be working with scientists, governments and communities to create a stable transition to alternative income sources and to track biological change in protected areas. A large part of the project will entail communicating that marine reserves <a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/abstract/S0169-5347(03)00189-7">are effective</a> and the economic benefits of restoring ecosystem services are worth it. In other words, (you guessed it) making the science matter.</span></span>
