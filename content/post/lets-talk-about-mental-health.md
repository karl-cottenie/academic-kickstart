Today. Tomorrow. Every day. Because it requires attention year round.&nbsp;<br /><br />And the start of the semester is an appropriate time to bring up this study by <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733317300422" target="_blank">Levecque and co-authors</a>, covered in <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2017/04/phd-students-face-significant-mental-health-challenges" target="_blank">Science</a>, that focuses on graduate students. It quantifies the problem, but also identified consistent predictors of mental health issues:&nbsp;<br /><br /><ul><li>work-life conflicts</li><li>high job demands</li><li>low job control&nbsp;</li></ul>The story I come up with based on these results is that low job controls leads to (a perception of) high job demands, to work-life conflicts, to mental health symptoms. And what could be related to low job control and/or high job demands? Maybe supervisor style, which can either diminish the prevalence of mental health issues when it is perceived as inspirational, or increase when it is perceived as laissez-faire. This again stresses the crucial importance of the supervisor-graduate student relationship, one of the recurrent themes in these news items.&nbsp;<br /><br />Another recurrent theme in these news items is the importance of reasonable job expectations, potentially non-academic ones. It is thus maybe not a coincidence that "Positive perception of career outside academia" has a strong positive effect on graduate mental health. If you know that all the hard work will eventually lead to a satisfying job that requires this education, and not necessarily a low probability faculty position after an endless series of postdocs, maybe that makes all the hard work worth it.
