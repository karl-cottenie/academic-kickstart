As I recently noticed, the majority of my posts here are unconsciously driven by the courses that I am preparing. The couple of posts on natural history and science are basically an illustration to my field course that I will be teaching next week (hopefully I will get some time to blog from the field). And in the fall, I will be teaching a grad stats course for the first time. As a transition between these two courses, here is a recent discovery: the blog "<a href="http://www.datatelling.com/blog/">Datatelling</a>", where the author defines herself as datateller: "explorer of data, a creator of information, a person who loves to look at numbers".<br /><br />Here is an example of her latest post on<a href="http://www.datatelling.com/2011/07/29/wind-flow/"> Wind Flow</a>:<br /><br /><iframe frameborder="0" height="225" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/27039654?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="400"></iframe><br /><a href="http://vimeo.com/27039654">Wind Flow</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/datatelling">Jen Lowe</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a>.<br /><br />Interestingly, there seems to be a concurrent debate in these circles between data tellers and statisticians. And don't we love a good discussion with pointed arguments? Here are two starting points (for me, not aware at all with this debate):<br /><br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.datatelling.com/2011/08/03/why-aesthetics-vs-utility-is-beside-the-point-and-meaning-matters/">http://www.datatelling.com/2011/08/03/why-aesthetics-vs-utility-is-beside-the-point-and-meaning-matters/</a></li><li><a href="http://andrewgelman.com/2011/08/using-a-pure-infographic-to-explore-differences-between-information-visualization-and-statistical-graphics/">http://andrewgelman.com/2011/08/using-a-pure-infographic-to-explore-differences-between-information-visualization-and-statistical-graphics/</a></li></ul><br /><br />
