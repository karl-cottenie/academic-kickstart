Since starting these news items, we have discussed themes related to mental health issues, their causes, and some solutions. Ardon Schnorr, a Biology PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University wrote a very powerful article around this theme that touches on a lot of issues surrounding this problem: <a href="http://www.chronicle.com/article/Grad-School-Is-Hard-on-Mental/240626">http://www.chronicle.com/article/Grad-School-Is-Hard-on-Mental/240626</a>. It is a must read for any graduate student. And if you are inspired by the positive effects of science communication, but do not know where to start, you can always start with the University of Guelph <a href="http://outreach.letstalkscience.ca/uguelph.html" target="_blank">Let's Talk Science outreach program</a>.
