For all the field ecologists currently creative with flagging tape, know that you can use a different output for your creativity. See the embedded video between minutes 1:30-6:20.<br /><br /><br /><iframe frameborder="0" height="338" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/20946982?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff" width="600"></iframe><br /><a href="http://vimeo.com/20946982">NOVA the film</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/rojo">ROJO</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a>.<br /><br />ps: if this is your thing, I highly recommend watching the full documentary (during several lunchtimes, for instance, you can watch it in chunks).
