<div style="color: #333333; font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;; font-size: 13px;"><a data-cke-saved-href="http://ecologybits.com/index.php/2016/12/14/how-not-to-get-a-postdoc-position/" href="http://ecologybits.com/index.php/2016/12/14/how-not-to-get-a-postdoc-position/" style="color: #0782c1;">Great story,</a>&nbsp;with a clear message that is equally applicable to non-academic jobs after your PhD or MSc degree: you should be thinking about this during your graduate work, and not wait until you are almost done. Below, I have taken the her final paragraph, and I have made it a little bit more general (the bold sections are my changes):</div><blockquote class="tr_bq" style="color: #333333; font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;; font-size: 13px;">"In general, Iâ€™ve seen that the people who get ahead in [academic ecology]&nbsp;<strong>the job market</strong>&nbsp;are those who have a clear vision of what [research]&nbsp;<strong>job</strong>&nbsp;they want to pursue and why it matters. As you finish your PhD, spend time thinking about a few possible future [research]&nbsp;<strong>job</strong>&nbsp;directions. What do you want to [discover] contribute to society? Why? And what will it take to make those [discoveries]&nbsp;<strong>contributions</strong>?"</blockquote>
