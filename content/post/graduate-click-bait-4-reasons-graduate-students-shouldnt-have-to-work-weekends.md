Despite the click-bait nature of the blog,<a href="http://blogs.plos.org/blog/2017/02/21/4-reasons-graduate-students-shouldnt-have-to-work-weekends/"> this blog post</a> has some perspectives that a lot of graduate students in our department will probably be able to relate to. Now I just wonder how many faculty members have a different perspective.
