Brittany's <a href="http://journal.lib.uoguelph.ca/index.php/surg/article/view/1318">first publication stemming</a> from her undergraduate research project during the Algonquin field course has just been published. She was part of team IDH (for obvious reasons), and they worked their butts of to collect the data: finding an interesting question based on her previous community ecology course, interviewing park people to find stands with known time-to-logging, collecting the data, tiring out the TAs who helped them (or maybe slowed them down), breaking down her field vehicle, of course exactly on the one day I came out with them.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0tuxSJ7d23k/TeZ50dk15MI/AAAAAAAAAS0/QIdhiQKMH6M/s1600/5530_664048655219_120813400_42235708_7516989_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0tuxSJ7d23k/TeZ50dk15MI/AAAAAAAAAS0/QIdhiQKMH6M/s320/5530_664048655219_120813400_42235708_7516989_n.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Team IDH as the intrepid explorers</td></tr></tbody></table>
