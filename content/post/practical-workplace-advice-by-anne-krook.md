<br />Anne Krook has a <a href="http://annekrook.com/?page_id=570">page full of practical advice on how to get a non-academic employment</a>, which is something that I have been looking for for a long time. So here is the link, and all beginning grad students should consult this page in the first semester of their program. She even has a post titled "can non-academic careers be Plan A yet?"!
