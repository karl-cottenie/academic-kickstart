One of the items in the grading rubric Marianne Staempfli and I developed for concept maps is the importance of cross links in the arrangement of the concept map:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="background-color: transparent;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.14601261354982853" style="background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">"Cross links show complex relationships between two or more distinct segments of the concept map"</span></span></div></blockquote>It is one of the reasons why I am currently involved in a collaboration (among some others) on genome (or transposon) ecology by co-advising Brent Saylor with Ryan Gregory, and on anthropology in ecology by co-advising Ingrid Ng with Bob Jickling.<br /><br />And here is another cross link I was recently struck by:<a href="http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/"> "Up and down the ladder of abstraction" by Bret Victor</a>&nbsp;(no screen shot, because you have to explore the site in person) -<br /><br />which I think is linked to "Engineering data analysis" by Hadley Wickham.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/TaxJwC_MP9Q" width="560"></iframe><br /><br />Both advocate an explicit visual tool to explore complicated and unexpected patterns between groups of variables. The domain specific visual language advocated by Hadley Wickham, I think, implicitly provides a model to obtain the different levels of abstractions necessary for moving up and down your data iteratively in R.<br /><br />Would Hadley Wickham have Bret Victor in his RSS reader? If not, I think he should, because imagine what would happen if we put these two together in the same room.
