The Churchill Northern Studies Centre has hosted researchers from the Cottenie lab for the past couple years. This year we were invited to contribute a short write-up on our summer 2009 field season. You can read the article here:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.churchillscience.ca/documents/Newsletter_Winter_2010.pdf">http://www.churchillscience.ca/documents/Newsletter_Winter_2010.pdf</a><br /><br />Also, be sure to check out the CNSC's website for a preview of their new facility! The staff and volunteers at the CNSC are very supportive and a terrific resource for anyone doing science in the north.
