I could not resist <a href="http://thisisindexed.com/2011/02/denial-vs-progress/">posting this cartoon</a>.

Creating that process efficiently and effectively, however, is of course a completely different question. <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://thisisindexed.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/card2822.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="204" src="http://thisisindexed.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/card2822.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>
