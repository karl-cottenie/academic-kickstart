Robin Sloan wrote a<a href="http://stories.robinsloan.com/east-wind/"> beautiful short story (The truth about the east wind)</a>, with a very interesting format. It looks at the tension between religion and science, from a Greek tragedy perspective (you should really read it).<br /><blockquote>"<span class="Apple-style-span" style="background-color: white; line-height: 28px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">Zeus formed it into a girl and set her free to walk the earth. This was Athena. Pure curiosity. The spark made flesh.&nbsp;</span></span></blockquote><blockquote><span class="Apple-style-span" style="background-color: white; line-height: 28px;">From the day she was formed, Athena was an omnivorous observer, a kind of super Galileo/Darwin long before either was born. She made measurements and formed hypotheses. She classified plants and bent down to watch bugs up close. She counted the seconds between her fatherâ€™s lightning strikes and the thunder that followed</span></blockquote><blockquote><span class="Apple-style-span" style="background-color: white; line-height: 28px;">.</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="background-color: white; line-height: 28px;">Zeus had formed her well: her eyes were like microscopes, her feet like seismographs. She could taste numbers (even, sweet; odd, sour; prime, umami). She could smell questions. She could hear gravity.</span></blockquote><blockquote><span class="Apple-style-span" style="background-color: white; line-height: 28px;">Athena was the nerd god."</span></blockquote>Eurus, the East Wind ("<span class="Apple-style-span" style="background-color: white; line-height: 28px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">He became a mercenary hunter-killer, serving man and god alike. He was the original smart bomb. He was the invisible hand. He was the dagger that came down the chimney. He was the plague a la carte.")</span></span>, tries to kill her, but she escapes because of her scientific knowledge. She ultimately disappears, but is she completely gone? <a href="http://stories.robinsloan.com/east-wind/">Read the rest of the story</a>, and do not forget that it is our job to blow like the wind!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://stories.robinsloan.com/east-wind/not-pictured-990.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="215" src="http://stories.robinsloan.com/east-wind/not-pictured-990.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />
