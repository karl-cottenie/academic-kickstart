This is something we have known for the last 10 years (or 20) through for instance the research done by Eric Mazur and collaborators.<a href="http://aapt.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1119/1.1374249" target="_blank"> They showed</a> that using peer instruction improved student learning of physics concepts by 20% in a real-world, class setting, compared to a "regular" lecture-based approach with the sage on the stage imparting their wisdom to the young susceptible minds!<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gmbGhFvxS6s/WQmtr0YTf3I/AAAAAAABfZI/VFdpMXO3arQ6-lScbkXPhmqkuGVj7iA6gCLcB/s1600/Screenshot%2B2017-05-03%2Bat%2B6.10.37%2BAM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gmbGhFvxS6s/WQmtr0YTf3I/AAAAAAABfZI/VFdpMXO3arQ6-lScbkXPhmqkuGVj7iA6gCLcB/s320/Screenshot%2B2017-05-03%2Bat%2B6.10.37%2BAM.png" width="312" /></a></div>That is a fine example of a very deliberate teaching practice. Sometimes the learning is much more ... unexpected. In Winter 2017, I organized a graduate course called "Ecological statistics through time" that was mainly student taught, by design. I will devote some blog posts on some of these experiences, but one of the fun outcomes was something I did not (could not) anticipate.<br /><br />The students in the course had a wide range of experience with R, from 3+ years of daily coding for a MSc degree to just one undergrad intro stats course. This made teaching R a challenge, because I had to constantly try and accommodate these extremes (with varying levels of success probably). But the advantage was that I had plenty of best practice examples that did not come from me, but from their peers. For instance, I have collected and created some best practice documents for R coding in the <a href="http://www.cottenielab.org/p/projects.html" target="_blank">Resource page on my website</a>.<br /><br />But what is not on this page, and what a lot of students had fun with for their final reproducible coding assignment, was something that they learned from Joey. He and Sharon posted some R code for their discussion, and it had this header:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pCXkmb9Co18/WQnY-qJJkfI/AAAAAAABfZ0/C52Ib_7CaeMHmaQv_cTmSOdBLeHrd5iUQCLcB/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-05-03%2Bat%2B9.18.26%2BAM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="45" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pCXkmb9Co18/WQnY-qJJkfI/AAAAAAABfZ0/C52Ib_7CaeMHmaQv_cTmSOdBLeHrd5iUQCLcB/s320/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-05-03%2Bat%2B9.18.26%2BAM.png" width="320" /></a></div><div class="" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">And this style showed up in some modesty in their peers' code:&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_2fTM1_0gsE/WQnY-esOdCI/AAAAAAABfZk/B8iBihAotK4lGLSNJVtoWci0dwmTDowWwCLcB/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-05-03%2Bat%2B9.09.25%2BAM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="48" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_2fTM1_0gsE/WQnY-esOdCI/AAAAAAABfZk/B8iBihAotK4lGLSNJVtoWci0dwmTDowWwCLcB/s320/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-05-03%2Bat%2B9.09.25%2BAM.png" width="320" /></a></div><br />But some also went to town with this idea, and went beyond expectations:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iivXtro_eFw/WQnY-VupgRI/AAAAAAABfZs/PkZAfX01cyEO07pvCfcdFcG0plIK5FWYQCLcB/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-05-03%2Bat%2B9.10.26%2BAM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="201" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iivXtro_eFw/WQnY-VupgRI/AAAAAAABfZs/PkZAfX01cyEO07pvCfcdFcG0plIK5FWYQCLcB/s320/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-05-03%2Bat%2B9.10.26%2BAM.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DbeA7xya1wg/WQnY-qQ3V5I/AAAAAAABfZw/iZefQKr3VrAV3VlJG9pbJVLSrgLmrN7DgCLcB/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-05-03%2Bat%2B9.12.36%2BAM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="166" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DbeA7xya1wg/WQnY-qQ3V5I/AAAAAAABfZw/iZefQKr3VrAV3VlJG9pbJVLSrgLmrN7DgCLcB/s320/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-05-03%2Bat%2B9.12.36%2BAM.png" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">And it is hard to pick the best one, but this is one of my favourites:</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RaqUR6r1XrY/WQo2k3g6jSI/AAAAAAABfaM/nG3vjJdMYQI81rP_a3LF33fOlf7JdpwmACLcB/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-05-03%2Bat%2B3.58.22%2BPM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="125" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RaqUR6r1XrY/WQo2k3g6jSI/AAAAAAABfaM/nG3vjJdMYQI81rP_a3LF33fOlf7JdpwmACLcB/s320/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-05-03%2Bat%2B3.58.22%2BPM.png" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div>&nbsp;Awesome.<br /><br />
