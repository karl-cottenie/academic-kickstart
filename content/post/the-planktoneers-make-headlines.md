We will participate as a lab to the species parade in Kitchener/Waterloo. Our theme? The <a href="http://dabluff.blogspot.com/">planktoneers</a>, of course. This seems not to be the most obvious theme, so we are mentioned in <a href="http://news.therecord.com/News/Local/article/684847">some of the local papers</a>. As Ingrid wrote: "The heat is on".
