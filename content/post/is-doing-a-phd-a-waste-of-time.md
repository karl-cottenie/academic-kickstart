Some people definitely think so. These types of articles crop up regularly. Here is a <a href="https://medium.com/the-economist/why-doing-a-phd-is-often-a-waste-of-time-349206f9addb#.mj9s1xnby">recent version of this type of analysis</a> that re-appeared in Medium, but is originally from 2010. These are like the villain in a horror movie, every time you think he is finally dead, ominous music fills the theatre. The linked-to article has some aspects that set it apart, though. It provides a voice of faculty members, in addition to some short-writing gems. The quote below has both:<br /><div><blockquote class="tr_bq">"Monica Harris, a professor of psychology at the University of Kentucky, is a rare exception. She believes that too many PhDs are being produced, and has stopped admitting them. But such unilateral academic birth control is rare."</blockquote></div>
