Here is a great post, over on ProfHacker, about advice to new grad students: <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogPost/blogPost-content/26326/">An open letter to new graduate students, by Brian Croxall.</a>&nbsp;While I agree with most of these topics with varying degrees, they did not include the most important piece of advise, probably because it is so obvious: <b>ask questions</b>. Our role as advisors is to advise, but we can only do this if we get questions. Come in my office, send me an email, skype, whatever. And if I do not answer, which will happen, as some will attest to quite vocally, resend the email.
